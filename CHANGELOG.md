# Changelog

All notable changes to the DeployHQ CLI are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While the CLI is pre-1.0, minor versions may carry breaking changes to the public
`pkg/sdk` surface; these are always called out under **Breaking (SDK)**.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- **`dhq deploy` / `dhq api`**: prompt with an interactive project picker when
  `-p/--project` is omitted, and detect shell-mangled API paths so `dhq api`
  calls with rewritten slashes still resolve (#35).

### Documentation

- **Agent skill discovery**: removed three stale, frontmatter-less `SKILL.md`
  copies (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, `docs/`) that caused `npx skills add` to emit
  "missing required frontmatter" warnings on every install. The canonical skill
  remains `skills/deployhq/SKILL.md`. Added a skills.sh install badge and section
  to the README, and documented the managed-resources eligibility check
  (`dhq api GET /profile`) and beta-enrollment escape hatch in the launch
  reference (#37).

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-14

Broad expansion of API coverage (DHQ-639): account-level resources, template
sub-resources, managed hosting, and project/server actions. See #31, #32, #33.

### Breaking (SDK)

These affect external importers of `github.com/deployhq/deployhq-cli/pkg/sdk` and
scripts that parse the JSON output of existing commands. They correct types that
never matched the live API (the old fields were populated from a response shape
the backend does not return), so end-user behaviour of `dhq launch` is fixed
rather than regressed.

- **`ManagedHostingSize`**: renamed `Description` → `Label` and
  `PriceMonthly` → `MonthlyCost`; removed `PriceHourly`, `Memory`, `VCPUs`,
  `Disk`; added `Currency`. Matches the `{ "sizes": [...] }` envelope from
  `GET /managed_hosting/sizes`.
- **`ManagedHostingRegion`**: removed `Available`; added `Flag` and `Country`.
  Regions are now served grouped (`{ "grouped_regions": {...} }`).
- **`Client.UpdateConfigFile`**: now takes `ConfigFileUpdateRequest` (all-pointer
  fields for partial updates) instead of `ConfigFileCreateRequest`.
- **`dhq launch --dry-run --json`**: `monthly_cost` is now currency-aware
  (e.g. `£12.00`, `12.00 SEK`) instead of always `$X.XX`. Update any parser that
  assumes a leading `$`.

### Added

- **Account resources**: `dhq folders`, `dhq users`, `dhq account`,
  `dhq profile`, `dhq api-keys`, `dhq teams` (account-level permission groups),
  and `dhq ssh-keys download` (writes with secure `0600` permissions).
- **Project actions**: `dhq projects regenerate-key`,
  `dhq projects undeployed-changes`, `dhq projects ai-overview`.
- **Server actions**: `dhq servers from-global`, `dhq servers metrics` (beta).
- **Global links**: `dhq config-files link-global|unlink-global` and
  `dhq ssh-commands link-global|unlink-global`.
- **Managed hosting**: `dhq hosted-resources list|show|sync|retry-provision` and
  `dhq managed-hosting regions|sizes`.
- **Template sub-resources**: `dhq templates {config-files, excluded-files,
  integrations, commands, build-commands, build-cache-files, build-known-hosts,
  build-languages, build-configuration, servers, server-groups}`.
- **Utilities**: `dhq ip-ranges`, `dhq plans`, `dhq invoices list|download`,
  `dhq detect`, `dhq beta enroll`.
- **SDK**: `NewPublic(account, …)` client path for public, no-auth endpoints
  (`ip-ranges`, `plans`).

### Changed

- `dhq config-files update` now performs partial updates — unset `--path`/`--body`
  flags are no longer sent, so they are left untouched server-side instead of
  being cleared.
